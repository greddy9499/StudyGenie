StudyGenie AI – Adaptive Multimodal Learning Intelligence System

StudyGenie AI is an adaptive learning platform that transforms passive studying into measurable skill progression. The system ingests PDFs and lecture videos, converts them into structured knowledge, and applies AI-driven assessments to track concept mastery, retention, and growth.

Unlike traditional note generators, StudyGenie focuses on cognitive improvement. It integrates active recall, adaptive difficulty scaling, and a LevelUp progression engine to help students identify weak concepts, prevent forgetting, and improve long-term retention.

Key Features • PDF and video ingestion with structured knowledge extraction • Automatic quiz generation based on concepts • Weak-topic detection at concept level • Forgetting-curve inspired smart revision planner • LevelUp AI engine with XP-based mastery tracking • Skill metrics: accuracy, retention, speed, consistency • Concept heat map and growth dashboard

Architecture Overview

The system follows a layered architecture:

User Layer – Upload, Quiz Interface, Dashboard

Processing Layer – Content extraction and semantic structuring

Intelligence Engine – Adaptive quizzes, mastery tracking, revision logic

Data Layer – Vector database, embeddings, performance analytics

Tech Stack

Frontend: React / Next.js Backend: FastAPI AI: LLM-based summarization, quiz generation, embeddings Database: Vector DB + Performance store

Vision

StudyGenie AI aims to bridge the gap between content consumption and skill mastery by combining artificial intelligence with cognitive science principles. The platform promotes structured, measurable, and ethical learning.
